# Sample Django Blog App

- This is just a sample README explaining that this application was built after following a video series in Django which covers the basics of Django development and also file storage using S3 as well as uploading to the cloud through Linode and Heroku.

- As of the test branch I definitely need to refactor how I wrote the code for my tests. I also should've commented my thought process so I will be getting around to that. For automated testing there's many things for me to learn so I'm prioritizing that over high quality code and readibility.
